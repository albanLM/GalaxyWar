# Galaxy War

This game is an old project I worked on in university for a programming course. I uploaded it to github for the sake of not loosing it.
The game is a simple space war simulation where species must fight to conquer planets.
Here are the rules :
* The game starts with a fixed number of species and planets 
* Each species owns a fleet and can move their ships on a grid
* Each ship can be of three different type :
  - Fighter : Can attack enemy ships
  - Bomber : Can attack enemy planets
  - Settler : Can colonize a planet if it is empty
* Each entity caracterisics are randomized

The rules come from the project document that I lost. The rules may be updated one day if I find it again.

In it's current state, the game does not work. I think the files I managed to retreive are from an early version of the project.
